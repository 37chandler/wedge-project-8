## Feedback 

I think the NULL-as-string vs "actual NULL" is the thing causing that discrepancy. No need to hunt it down. 

Your point about when to scrap everything versus when to push forward on the current path is a really important one. We should discuss this in class at some point. 


Nice work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 


### Task 1

* Great work on the processing of the zip files. Very easy to read and comprehensive. 
* Also nice work on the upload. That's about as efficient as it gets. 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* I appreciate that you took the time to do this with the reproducible approach. 

### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient. 
* Great job getting the query correct. MANY people failed to do that.
